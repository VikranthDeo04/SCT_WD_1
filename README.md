# 🌐 Responsive Landing Page

A modern, **responsive landing page** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It features an **interactive navigation bar** that changes color or style when scrolling or hovering over menu items.  
The navigation menu remains **fixed** at the top and is **visible on all sections/pages** for smooth navigation.

## 🧠 How It Works

The **JavaScript** file listens for scroll events and dynamically adds or removes classes from the navbar.  
When you scroll down, the navbar’s background or shadow changes to indicate movement.  
Hover effects are handled via **CSS transitions** for smooth, fluid feedback.
